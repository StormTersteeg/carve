## About The Project

I created Carve because I often use online compressors for my CSS. Sometimes, I want to compress my CSS when no internet is around. Carve may not be the best compressor around, but it works.

Carve is a css compressor with a simple command-line interface. You can have multiple instances of Carve to compress files while you develop. The application detects file changes.

It uses a progressive compression method. This method detects css variables and it will apply and get rid of root{} declarations.

I use Carve all the time and there are some issues. I would not recommend using Carve commercially, but it will function well if you just need a simple css compressor.

## Compression rate
The displayed compression rate is calculated using the following formula:
`rate in % = (compressed_size / original_size) * 100`

For example, if you have a 200kbs css file and the compressed version is 150kbs, Carve will give a compression rate of 75%.
